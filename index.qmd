These notes provide detailed documentation of the functions and experiments used in our appointment scheduling research. Our approach is built on two key components:

-   **Evaluator Functions:**\
    A collection of functions responsible for evaluating the objective function for a given schedule. These functions compute essential performance metrics (e.g., expected waiting time, expected spillover) that help assess the quality of a schedule.

-   **Searcher Functions:**\
    A suite of functions designed to generate neighborhoods around a given solution and explore the surrounding search space. These functions use the evaluator functions to guide the search for improved schedules.

## To Do {.unnumbered}

-   [x] **Add a brief introduction to the project**
-   [x] **Evaluator Functions**
    -   [x] Document and test the evaluator functions
    -   [x] Run experiments using the evaluator functions
-   [x] **Searcher Functions**
    -   [x] Document and test the search functions
    -   [ ] Run experiments using the search functions
