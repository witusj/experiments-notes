	abstract = {In this paper optimal outpatient appointment scheduling is studied. A local search procedure is derived that converges to the optimal schedule with a weighted average of expected waiting times of patients, idle time of the doctor and tardiness (lateness) as objective. No-shows are allowed to happen. For certain combinations of parameters the well-known Bailey-Welch rule is found to be the optimal appointment schedule.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study the problem of deciding at what times to schedule patients when there are emergency arrivals following a non-stationary Poisson process. The service times can be any given distribution. The objective function consists of a weighted sum of the waiting times, idle time and tardiness. We prove that this objective function is multimodular, and then use a local search algorithm which in that case is guaranteed to ﬁnd the optimal solution. Numerical examples show that this method gives considerable improvements over the standard even-spaced schedule, and that the schedules for di↵erent service time distributions can look quite di↵erent.},

	url = {https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/deshwal23a.html},
	abstract = {We consider the problem of optimizing expensive black-box functions over high-dimensional combinatorial spaces which arises in many science, engineering, and ML applications. We use Bayesian Optimization (BO) and propose a novel surrogate modeling approach for efficiently handling a large number of binary and categorical parameters. The key idea is to select a number of discrete structures from the input space (the dictionary) and use them to define an ordinal embedding for high-dimensional combinatorial structures. This allows us to use existing Gaussian process models for continuous spaces. We develop a principled approach based on binary wavelets to construct dictionaries for binary spaces, and propose a randomized construction method that generalizes to categorical spaces. We provide theoretical justification to support the effectiveness of the dictionary-based embeddings. Our experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed surrogate modeling approach over state-of-the-art BO methods.},
