        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Outpatient appointment scheduling is a critical operational challenge in healthcare systems, striving to efficiently manage patient flow while balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives. The core dilemma involves minimizing patient waiting times, reducing clinician idle time, and preventing clinic sessions from running excessively late (tardiness). Effectively addressing this requires robust scheduling policies that can adapt to inherent uncertainties, such as variable service times and patient no-shows.\n",
        "\n",
        "Work by @kaandorp_optimal_2007 provides a comprehensive mathematical framework for tackling this problem. They proposed an objective function that considers a weighted average of expected patient waiting times, doctor idle time, and session tardiness, explicitly incorporating the possibility of patient no-shows. A key contribution of their research was the demonstration that, under certain conditions, their objective function exhibits multimodularity. This property is significant because it guarantees that a local search algorithm can converge to a globally optimal appointment schedule. Their model assumes discrete time intervals and exponentially distributed service times.\n",
        "\n",
        "This document details a computational exploration and implementation inspired by the principles and challenges outlined in the work of Kaandorp and Koole. Our primary objective is to investigate the characteristics of optimal, or near-optimal, appointment schedules under various parameter settings. While the original paper focuses on the theoretical properties and a local search method, this study employs a direct enumeration and evaluation approach for a specific class of schedule structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, we implement a Python-based model to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Generate a Service Time Distribution:** Create a plausible distribution of patient service times with a target average, allowing for variability.\n",
        "2.  **Construct Candidate Schedules:** Systematically generate a variety of patient appointment schedules. The schedules explored here are characterized by a defined number of patients at the beginning ('start') and end ('tail') of the session, with the remaining patients distributed as evenly as possible across the central portion of the available time intervals.\n",
        "3.  **Evaluate Schedule Performance:** For each generated schedule, calculate an objective function value. This objective is a weighted sum, reflecting the trade-off between minimizing expected patient waiting time (EWT) and minimizing expected service provider underutilization or overtime (ESP). This evaluation incorporates the probability of patient no-shows (`q_no_show`) and a user-defined weight (`w_weight`) to adjust the relative importance of EWT and ESP.\n",
        "4.  **Visualize and Analyze Results:** Utilize interactive 3D visualizations to explore the solution space. This allows for the examination of how different parameters—such as the no-show probability (`q`), the objective function weight (`w`), and the total number of patients (`N_patients`)—influence the structure of optimal schedules and their corresponding objective values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Through this computational study, we aim to gain deeper insights into the sensitivity of optimal schedules to key operational parameters and to visualize the complex trade-offs inherent in outpatient appointment systems. The findings from this enumerative approach can also serve as a benchmark and provide foundational understanding for the development or comparison of more sophisticated heuristic or exact optimization algorithms.\n"
