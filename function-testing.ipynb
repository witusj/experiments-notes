        "\n",
        "For developing new methods for optimizing appointment schedules it is necessary that the function for calculating objective values works properly. It is also important that the function is efficient, as it will be used in optimization algorithms that will be run many times.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hypothesis\n",
        "\n",
        "The functions for calculating that have been developed are working fast and generate correct results.\n",

        "\n",
        "For testing the correct working of the functions used to calculate objective values we will compare the exact calculation to results from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The MC simulations allow modeling the system and replicating closely the actual process of patients arriving and being served. The exact calculation is based on the convolution of the service time distribution and the number of patients arriving at each time slot.\n",
