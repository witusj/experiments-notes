Therefore in this experiment we only sample pairs of schedules taken from within the vicinity of a 'good' starting point.*\n",

        "## Hypothesis\n",

        "*We wanted to test whether an XGBoost classification model could be used to assess and rank the quality of pairs of schedules. For performance benchmarking we use the conventional calculation method utilizing Lindley recursions.*\n",
        "\n",
        "*We trained the XGBoost ranking model with a limited set of features (schedules) and labels (objectives). The total number of possible schedules is approximately `{python} round(math.comb(N + T - 1, N) / 1000000, 0)` million. For training and evaluation, we sampled `{python} 2*num_schedules` schedules and corresponding neighbors. Generating the feature and label set took a total of `{python} round(training_set_feat_time + training_set_lab_time, 4)` seconds, with the calculation of objective values accounting for `{python} round(training_set_lab_time, 4)` seconds.*\n",

        "*The model demonstrates strong and consistent performance with high accuracies both for training, testing and validation (`{python} round(df[\"Cumulative accuracy\"].min()*100, 2)`%) with good generalization and stability. Total training time for the final model was `{python} round(modeling_time, 4)` seconds. The evaluation of `{python} num_test_schedules` test schedules took `{python} round(prediction_time, 4)` seconds for the the XGBoost model and `{python} round(evaluation_time, 4)` for the conventional method, which is an improvement of `{python} int(evaluation_time/prediction_time)`X.*\n",
