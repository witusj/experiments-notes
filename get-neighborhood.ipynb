        "\n",
        "This notebook provides documentation for the function `get_neighborhood`, which generates the neighborhood of a solution vector by adding combinations of adjustment vectors from a precomputed array (`v_star`). The function filters out any candidate neighbors that result in negative values.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Function Documentation\n",
        "\n",
        "`get_neighborhood(x: Union[List[int], np.ndarray], v_star: np.ndarray, ids: List[List[int]], verbose: bool = False) -> np.ndarray`\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Description\n",
        "\n",
        "The `get_neighborhood` function computes a set of neighbor solutions by adding together selected rows from the array `v_star` to an initial solution vector `x`. The selection of rows is determined by the list of index lists `ids`, where each inner list represents a combination of indices. After generating the candidate neighbors, the function filters out any that contain negative values. An optional `verbose` flag provides debugging output during execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "- **x** (`Union[List[int], np.ndarray]`):  \n",
        "  The current solution vector. Can be provided as a list of integers or as a NumPy array.\n",

        "- **v_star** (`np.ndarray`):  \n",
        "  A 2D NumPy array where each row is an adjustment vector. These vectors are used to modify the current solution to explore its neighborhood.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **ids** (`List[List[int]]`):  \n",
        "  A list of index lists, where each inner list specifies which rows from `v_star` to sum together. Each combination represents a potential adjustment to the current solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **verbose** (`bool`, optional):  \n",
        "  A flag indicating whether to print debugging information (e.g., intermediate computations, progress messages). Defaults to `False`.\n",

        "- **`np.ndarray`**:  \n",
        "  A 2D NumPy array where each row is a neighbor solution (i.e., the result of adding a valid combination of adjustment vectors from `v_star` to `x`). Only neighbors with all non-negative entries are included in the output.\n",
