<p><strong>Objective</strong>: <em>Testing the performance of an XGBoost model trained for ranking pairwise schedules taken from a neighborhood around quasi optimal initial schedule (Bailey-Welch).</em></p>
</section>
<section id="background" class="level2" data-number="4.2">
<h2 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Background</h2>
<p><em>In a previous experiment we developed a Machine Learning model using XGBoost that can evaluate two neighboring schedules and rank them according to preference. For evaluation random schedules were sampled from the full solution set.</em></p>
<p><em>The full solution set however contains many schedules that are obviously not optimal. Adding them to the training set would provide the model with rather useless knowledge. Therefore in this experiment we only sample pairs of schedules taken from within the vicinity of a ‘good’ starting point.</em></p>

<section id="hypothesis" class="level2" data-number="4.3">
<h2 data-number="4.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hypothesis"><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Hypothesis</h2>
<p><em>An XGBoost ranking model achieves superior computational efficiency compared to evaluating each element of a pair individually, leading to faster overall performance in ranking tasks.</em></p>

<p><em>We will create a random set of pairs of neighboring schedules from within the neighborhood around schedule [2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 8].</em></p>
<p><em>A neighbor of a schedule x is considered a schedule x’ where single patients have been shifted one interval to the left. Eg: ([2,1,1,2], [1,2,0,3]) are neighbors and ([2,1,1,2], [2,1,3,0]) are not, because [1,2,0,3] - [2,1,1,2] = [-1, 1, -1, 1] and [2,1,3,0] - [2,1,1,2] = [0, 0, 2, -2].</em></p>
<p><em>Service times will have a discrete distribution. The probability of a scheduled patient not showing up will be</em> <span class="math inline">\(q = 0.2\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>The objective function will be the weighted average of the total waiting time of all patients and overtime. The model will be trained to predict which of the two neighboring schedules has the lowest objective value. The prediction time will be recorded. Then the same schedules will be evaluated by computing the objective value and then ranked.</em></p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: <em>Create pairs of neighboring schedules.</em> A set of 300000 schedules will be sampled from the neighborhood of the initial schedule. For each schedule a pair of neighbors will be created. The order of the neighbors will be randomly switched to create a more diverse training set. The time taken to sample the schedules and create the neighbors will be recorded.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: <em>To evaluate the performance of the XGBoost ranking model, we will use Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation with 5 splits, ensuring each fold maintains the same class distribution as the original dataset. Using StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=94), the dataset will be divided into five folds. In each iteration, the model will be trained on four folds and evaluated on the remaining fold. A custom callback, CustomCallback(period=10), will print the evaluation log every 10 epochs.</em></p>
<p><em>The fit_and_score function will fit the model and score it on both the training and test sets, storing the results for each fold. This provides insight into the model’s performance across different subsets of the data, helps in understanding how well the model generalizes to unseen data and identifies potential overfitting or underfitting issues. The overall processing time for the cross-validation will also be recorded.</em></p>

<p><em>In the initial model the choice of hyperparameters was based on default values, examples from demo’s or trial and error. To improve the model’s performance, we applied a <a href="https://optuna.org/" target="_blank">hyperparameter optimization technique</a> to find the best set of hyperparameters. We used a grid search with cross-validation to find the optimal hyperparameters for the XGBoost model. The grid search was performed over a predefined set of hyperparameters, and the best hyperparameters were selected based on the model’s performance on the validation set. The best hyperparameters were then used to train the final model.</em></p>

<p><em>We wanted to test whether an XGBoost classification model could be used to assess and rank the quality of pairs of schedules. For performance benchmarking we use the conventional calculation method utilizing Lindley recursions.</em></p>
<p><em>We trained the XGBoost ranking model with a limited set of features (schedules) and labels (objectives). The total number of possible schedules is approximately 244663.0 million. For training and evaluation, we sampled 600000 schedules and corresponding neighbors. Generating the feature and label set took a total of 162.0205 seconds, with the calculation of objective values accounting for 106.2047 seconds.</em></p>
<p><em>The model demonstrates strong and consistent performance with high accuracies both for training, testing and validation (96.1%) with good generalization and stability. Total training time for the final model was 5.1993 seconds. The evaluation of 1000 test schedules took 0.0048 seconds for the the XGBoost model and 0.3737 for the conventional method, which is an improvement of 78X.</em></p>
