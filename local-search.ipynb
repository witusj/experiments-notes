        "This notebook provides documentation for the function `local_search`, which performs a local search to optimize a scheduling solution. The function iteratively explores the neighborhood of the current best solution by switching a given number of patients. It utilizes precomputed convolution results and a set of adjustment vectors (`v_star`) to evaluate and improve the objective function.\n",

        "`local_search(x: Union[List[int], np.ndarray], d: int, convolutions: Dict[int, np.ndarray], w: float, v_star: np.ndarray, size: int = 2, echo: bool = False) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, float]`\n",

        "#### Description\n",
        "\n",
        "The `local_search` function optimizes a schedule by iteratively exploring its neighborhood. Starting with an initial solution `x`, the function computes its objective value using the precomputed convolutions of the service time probability mass function. The neighborhood is generated by combining adjustment vectors from `v_star` (using a powerset-based approach) and filtering out candidates that contain negative values. The search continues until no further improvement is found for neighborhoods up to the specified `size`. The objective function combines expected average waiting time per patient and spillover time weighted by `w`.\n",
